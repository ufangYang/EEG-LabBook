## Prof. Niedeggen Lab

**IMPORTANT**
- The Brain Product electrodes are extremely delicate and very expensive. Always handle them gently!
- Do not allow the electrodes themselves to touch metal, do not allow the plugs to touch water/gel
- Experimental timing information:
  - Preparation: 15-30 minutes
  - Testing: 2-3 hours
  - Clean up: 30 minutes
- Emergency number: XX | Lab location: JK 206, floor -1
- Remind the participant one day before arrival of the COVID-related exclusion criterions and wash their hair.

## 1. PREPARING FOR TESTING
### 1.1. BEFORE THE PARTICIPANT ARRIVES
- Ensure you have consent forms, payment, and a payment receipt
- Check for the necessary materials 
  - Syringes, abrasive Electrolyte-Gel, measuring tape, stickers, paper towels, cotton swab, 
  - Dry and clean caps (no gel residue obstructing the holes)
- Turn on and prepare computers 
  - Simulation PC: open Psychopy and launch the script for your experiment
  - EEG acquisition PC: open BrainVision Recorder and start a file for your new participant
  - Stimulation Monitor: turn it on, prepare to run your experiment
  - Note: Don’t use a recording computer to browse the Internet or playback multimedia 
- Set up any equipment (e.g., response box) you may need 
- Check amplifier battery 
- Fill the syringes with electrolyte gel/abrasive paste, prepare a small container for the electrolyte gel/abrasive paste and apply stickers to facial electrodes while the participant completes the consent/questionnaires

### 1.2. ONCE THE PARTICIPANT ARRIVES
- Instruct them to keep their personal belongings on the table in front of the entrance of the room. Phones and laptops should not be used in the recording room, neither by participants nor by experimenter 
- Participants and experimenters should keep their face mask on all the time.  
- Bring the participant to the table and seat them at the paperwork table to sign the consent forms (keep one per experiment)
- Administer the Questionnaires, get the participant code (e.g., 33101)
  - For Cyberball experiments, it is important that a participant did not participate before. 
  - Kindly ask if a participant needs to use the bathroom before the experiment 

## 2. CAPPING THE PARTICIPANT
- Measure head circumference around the widest part (just between the eyebrows to over the inion bump) and head length, from inion to nasion (Fig1a)
- Clean the facial electrode sites
  - Wipe area with alcohol, then with gel on paper towel
  - Remove residue with wet paper towel
  - Dry thoroughly
- Apply four facial electrodes. Remove the paper cover from the sticker and attach it to the face. Position cables to point away from the face. Place a small dot of gel into the electrode with the syringe (do not scratch).
  - VEOG up and VEOG down should be in line with the pupils
  - HEOG left and HEOG right should be as close together as possible (e.g., right on the eyebrow and high on the cheekbone)
  - Check VEOG electrodes do not obstruct vision when looking straight ahead (ask the participant if they see the electrodes - "centre", "left", or "right". - Without touching the cap, clean each electrode site and earlobe with alcohol (cotton swabs dipped in alcohol). Once each site and ear lobes are clean, dip the cotton swab into a small amount of electrolyte gel) and place the electrodes. Then insert the syringe into each site and slowly inject gel while withdrawing. Gel must touch the scalp (not just hair) – rock the syringe tip back and forward to part the hair. - The holes should be 75-100% filled, but not overflowing (too much gel can result in bridging of electrodes). - Place each electrode in the corresponding slot in the Input box.
